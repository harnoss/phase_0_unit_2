Bridging the gap

To me, the tech world sometimes comes across as a bubble. I remember attending the last Techrunch Disrupt Conference in SF and seeing all these smart people working on things like multiplayer games for smartphones, automatic typing technology for tablets, or wireless charging for electronic devices. All really cool stuff, no doubt about that. But when I left the conference and walked up some blocks to BART, something struck me: Homeless people on the streets, run-down coffee shops, and the sense that too much of the tech magic goes to waste. I feel that there is a gap between where the creative energy of the tech world goes into vs. where it could have most impact. It is like a world that circulates around itself.

There is no easy solution to that, but as a first step, I think, it helps to create awareness around this gap. Specifically important, in this context, is to ensure that the tech world remains close to the full breadth of living situations that people find themselves in. In order to solve a problem, one has to first see it. So let's open our eyes!
